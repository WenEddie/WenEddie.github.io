Association for Computing Machinery at University of Hawaii at Manoa (ACM/ACManoa) is a computer science student organization that hosts special interest groups to provide professional and technical knowledge to their members. I have been an attentive member who took part in Algorithms for Competitions and Interviews (ACI), and Grey Hats.

Beginning of my first semester at the university, my goal was to participate in some extra-curricular activity that would be helpful towards my major and future. The first two semesters, I went to the Grey Hats meeting almost every week. They talked about attack and defend systems, and reverse engineering. I also had the opportunity to participate in National Cyber League (NCL). My third semester, I attended ACI in order to help prepare for ICS 311, which is a required algorithms course, along with solving mock-interview problems. 

My experience so far as a member of ACM, taught me about cyber ethics, cyber defense, and algorithms, all of which are things I have not learned in a course. Another aspect was making connections with everyone surrounding the organization which is a huge support to my college experience.
