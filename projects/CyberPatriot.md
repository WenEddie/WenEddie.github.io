CyberPatriot is a national youth cyber security competition where a team of students work together on a virtual image to strengthen the system based on operating system and confront cybersecurity vulnerabilities. I was tasked to work on Windows 8, Windows 10, and Ubuntu throughout the two years.

At McKinley High School, during my first competition period, CyberPatriot VIII (2015-2016), we had a full team, so each operating system was assigned to two people. We would take turns of either working on the task, typing, or researching. During the second competition period, CyberPatriot IX (2016-2017), many of the upperclassman had graduated, hence, I had to become the leader. Our team managed to place first in Silver tier in CyberPatriot VIII and placed third in Bronze tier in CyberPatriot IX.

Through my years in CyberPatriot, this experience really sparked my interest in cyber security along with developing the skills needed. I have also learned to use Ubuntu operating system which I had never heard of before. CyberPatriot has helped develop my leadership skills when working with others as well as teaching them for the competitions.
