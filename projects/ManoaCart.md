At McKinley High School, during my first competition period, CyberPatriot VIII (2015-2016), we had a full team, so each operating system was assigned to two people. We would take turns of either working on the task, typing, or researching. During the second competition period, CyberPatriot IX (2016-2017), many of the upperclassman had graduated, hence, I had to become the leader. Our team managed to place first in Silver tier in CyberPatriot VIII and placed third in Bronze tier in CyberPatriot IX.

I have also learned to use Ubuntu operating system which I had never heard of before. CyberPatriot has helped develop my leadership skills when working with others as well as teaching them for the competitions.
