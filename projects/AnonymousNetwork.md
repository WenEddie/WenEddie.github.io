At McKinley High School, Senior Project is a project for seniors to study in a specific subject that required a minimum of 30 hours of fieldwork. The subject that I was most interested was anonymity network. The fieldwork I worked on was building a private Tor (software that enables anonymous communication) network.

My role was more of a self-directed learner with the help of an advisor. Initially, I needed to write a research paper about anonymity network to expand my knowledge for my potential fieldwork. After deciding my fieldwork goal, I needed to seek a community mentor to guide my project. A brief summary of my fieldwork begins by setting up laptops that were hardwired to a switch, create a webpage to indicate access, configured Tor software to assign relays to laptops, and used Wireshark to verify the private Tor network. Succeeding my fieldwork goal, a formal presentation is required to present towards the judges to determine if my Senior Project is well-accomplished. The judging panel found my work on Senior Project satisfactory.

This Senior Project experience has expanded my knowledge of my field of interests that encourages me to pursue the route of cyber security. I had also gained experience on an unfamiliar operating system (Linux) that were on the laptops. Lastly, the project encourages me to stay highly organized and time manage throughout the tasks.
